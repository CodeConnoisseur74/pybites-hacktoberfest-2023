# How To Make Your First Pull Request

## 1. Add your profile picture to the folder

## 2. Add your profile information

## 3. Wait for Pull Request to merge

## 4. Here is a quick reference guide for GitHub: [GitHub Guide](https://github.com/git-guides)

## 5. Celebrate - you've done your first pull request!!

- Aim to make more than 4 pull requests.
- Imagine you've only made 4 pull requests to different projects, but one of those projects isn't part of the Hacktoberfest event.
- In that case, your pull request won't be counted, leaving you with just 3 valid ones if those projects aren't excluded either.
- To ensure your success, I recommend making a pull request to your own repo, as long as it has the Hacktoberfest topic.
